I had a really hard time with HTML toward the end. I definitely have a new appreciation for people who know how to do it and love it. For me, the most confusing
part are the style elements that go up at the top. I will need to really study those or else I'll have to keep going back and seeing how to do them.

I think learning CSS will hopefully make my code just look better overall. I'm fascinated about how it's applied to HTML.

I tried to keep everything in this project very simple. I had a lot of trouble I got help from from someone I know who is really good at HTML because I was having trouble understanding certain elements.
