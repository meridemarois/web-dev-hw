<h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h1>
<h2>William Shakespeare</h2>

<hr />

<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date.<br />
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
  And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br />
  And ever fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
  By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;<br />
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br />
  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br />
  When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br />
     So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br />
  <br />
